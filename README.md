# 18ROBO Leak Detect Development

## Overview
Welcome to the **Leak Detection Development** repository! Our project is focused on developing a reliable system for detecting leaks in the MSU RoboCats' Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The RoboCats' submarine previously developed leaks that damaged its expensive electronics.â€‹ A system to prevent water damage will be developed. The system must detect water in the submarine at multiple levels.â€‹ The system must respond to detected water, initiating a shutdown protocol when the user's maximum threshold of water is reached.â€‹

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Real-time leak detection** using sensors and data analysis.
- **Hardware integration** with microcontrollers and embedded systems.
- **Visual Indications** for remote monitoring.
- **Data logging** for future analysis.
